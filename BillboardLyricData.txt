1	hot-holiday-songs	All I Want For Christmas Is You	Mariah Carey	30.0	1.0	2016-12-31	"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own

Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya

They don't see that it's a lot of us
Everybody move anonymous
Won't take that credit, I know where we get it
Them blessings be comin' from God above
I was doin' all kinda bad
Where the choir at? Tell 'em I need a verse
Hit the pew and tell God he's first
Hit the studio to body a verse
I remember pushin' mama's little white Hyundai with no gas money
I just bought a car, cash money
I ain't even tryna brag on it
I just tell it how it really is
I ain't trippin', they ain't feelin' this
I ain't sayin' I deserve nothin'
I'm just tryna talk about the benefits
I've been punchin' in the clock
Tryna keep the kitchen stocked
Man it's a blessin' 'cause we ain't ever had a lot
But all we need is all we got

If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby I'm too busy countin' all these blessings, blessings

You found me in the darkness
Wanderin' thru the desert
I was a hopeless fool
Now I'm hopelessly devoted
My chains are broken
And it all began with You
When love broke thru
And it all began with You
When love broke thru

I did all that I could to undo me
But You loved me enough to pursue me
Yeah, You drew me out of the shadows
Made me believe that I mattered, to You (You)

And the thorns still twist down in my side
All the promises said that we left for dead in the night

Because I'm moving on, letting go
Forget the past
I'm giving up the ghost
All we are is fading stars

Babies had a birthday, they gon' need a rain check

Broke man need a vacation, Mary Jane
Walk outside and everything is lovely

Party in the neighborhood and everybody on the street

Maybe it was yesterday or maybe 65

I'm still from the side, ready to die for the mission
Or meditate it, then I levitated, elevated, celebrated
You should celebrate it, this is that and better greatness
Good, good God
I'm a mad man, mathematics, statics,? in the stars
I'm a bad man, bask into battle
I'm a battered mad hatter with the earth on a platter
Meek and mild till I get freaking wild

This is not a warning
This is what you wanted on the table
'Crae, let 'em know the lil homie willing and able

Vegas, get active
Flipping your city like gentrification all in the ghetto up on a dirty mattress
Word to that Sister Act-ress
Nevada gets it crackin'
It's hot and J got a jacket
We'll peddle back if you askin' if love's a long practice a long practice
Full metal jacket dually known as a banana clip
Load magazine of ammunition
Magazines don't go bananas overloaded clips
Sinking ships ten-percenter
It's hotter than sprinters in Arizona
Juxtapose 'em to a snowman in Nova Scotia
It's Rap's Christopher Nolan
Picture me rolling, pistol emoji blaow
This a misconception triple threat
Did Givens flex?
Still a Christian? Yep
Don't need acknowledgement
Just respect the conglomerate
Double tap it and follow it
They shocked to see us like Donald Trump up in a taqueria
Watching Evita crying over Argentina
Or Maria dominating Serena
I'm trying to find a big homie for Slim Jesus

Thought everything I wanted was in this town

It took me long enough
But I woke up

In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back

Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds

She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes

I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know

Where could you be on such a lonely winter's night?

I can't stop wanting you this way
I can't face dreaming without you
That's why I'm searching night and day
This heart's a lonely hunter
These hands are frozen fists

Can you, my darling,
Can you picture this?
Dream if you can a courtyard,
An ocean of violets in bloom.
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat,
The heat between me and you.

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold. (So cold).
Maybe I'm just too demanding,
Maybe I'm just like my father - too bold.
Maybe you're just like my mother,
She's never satisfied. (She's never satisfied).
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like,

When doves cry.

Drive highways and byways to be there with you

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you

And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said Peter Pan that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the Woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

Away from all of reality

Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'

Gettin' so cold I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothing to explain
I'm a fuckin black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin John Lennon lenses like to see 'em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin' ""everybody's famous""
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rolling
She think she love me

Niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long, the consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
Cause young niggas is hard headed, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall I fight regardless,
Screaming ""fuck the law"", my life is lawless
That's what you call it
Ain't got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if the swiper chargeless
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes)
Let her know my life is on
For your eyes only

For your eyes do you understand
For your eyes do you understand me

You're probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you're hearing this it means unfortunately I'm no longer with you

So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too

Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded

(You know)
What you wanna see
Baby sing, relaxing

Yeah, bad boy baby
Ralph Tresvant
Biggie Smalls
Listen
Uh, yeah, babe
Oh, listen to me
Ah yeah

To sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga, the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders, in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the ep along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean

Heart torn, leaving blood stains
All over the tablecloth
And I could never scrub them out
But I won't let you haunt me
All the scars on my body
They won't keep me far from love
And you won't see me fall apart
Cause I turned so cold
And I thought I'd never make it
I could feel my pulses fading
Shed a tear for the love we've lost
Gotta look for a brand new start
You got me dreaming of a renaissance

(It's Bobby)
I been dancing with the devil, he was always good to me

And I've been walking in the shadow of a friendly enemy

But now I'm fucking broken, living in the moment
Shoulda known that you would bring me down
Yeah, I been dancing with the devil, like, oh, oh, oh, oh

The Cash Cash make my ass bounce back

It's Bobby
I guess I'll play the bad guy
I swear I told you last time
You knew I wasn't good for you
But you swore you hit the jackpot
And you swore you struck gold
You were stepping on your toes
Always tripping over nothing
But nothing's on the floor
I swear the time it takes
To congregate and conversate
